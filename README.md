# Privacy-Policies-as-Data

This repository explores text mining analysis of privacy policies using quanteda. The quanteda package allows us to perform analyses that focus on information retrieval. The file “Privacy Policies as Data.R” use three methods to compare a dataset of a group of privacy policies from the social media industry: (i) the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), (ii) Key Words in Context (KWIC), and (iii) and the Cosine similarity.
