# Privacy-Policies-as-Data

This repository explores text mining analysis of privacy policies using quanteda. The quanteda package allows us to perform analyses that focus on information retrieval. The file “Privacy Policies as Data.R” use three methods to compare a dataset of a group of privacy policies from the social media industry: (i) the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), (ii) Key Words in Context (KWIC), and (iii) and the Cosine similarity.

The companies' privacy policies are included in the files. For the data used in the code, those policies are under the following naming convention:
1)	“Privacy.xlsx” is a file for the group of privacy policies (Meta, Google and WhatsApp).
2)	“P1.xlsx” is a file containing the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. § 552a.
3)	“SG.xlsx” is a file containing the privacy policies of Google and Snap Inc.

For Microsoft Power BI users:
1)	The file “Word Cloud.pbix” allows the creation of word cloud visualizations in Power BI. The file is also available at https://appsource.microsoft.com/
