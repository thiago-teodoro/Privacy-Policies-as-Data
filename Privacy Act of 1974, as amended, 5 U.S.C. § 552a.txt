
specific actions specified therein. When implementing the Open Data Policy, agencies shall incorporate a full analysis of privacy, confidentiality, and security risks into each stage of the information lifecycle to identify information that should not be released. These review processes should be overseen by the senior agency offi­cial for privacy. It is vital that agencies not release in­formation if doing so would violate any law or policy, or jeopardize privacy, confidentiality, or national secu­rity. 
SEC. 3. Implementation of the Open Data Policy. To fa­cilitate effective Government-wide implementation of the Open Data Policy, I direct the following:

The CIO and CTO shall regularly update this online repository as needed to ensure it remains a resource to facilitate the adoption of open data practices. 

(b)
 Within 90 days of the issuance of the Open Data Policy, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, Controller of the Office of Federal Financial Management, CIO, and Administrator of OIRA shall work with the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, Chief Financial Officers Council, Chief Information Officers Council, and Federal Records Council to identify and initiate implementation of measures to support the in­tegration of the Open Data Policy requirements into Federal acquisition and grant-making processes. Such efforts may include developing sample requirements language, grant and contract language, and workforce tools for agency acquisition, grant, and information management and technology professionals. 

(c)
 Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Chief Performance Officer (CPO) shall work with the Presi­dent’s Management Council to establish a Cross-Agen­cy Priority (CAP) Goal to track implementation of the Open Data Policy. The CPO shall work with agencies to set incremental performance goals, ensuring they have metrics and milestones in place to monitor advance­ment toward the CAP Goal. Progress on these goals shall be analyzed and reviewed by agency leadership, pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (Pub­lic Law 111–352). 

(d)
 Within 180 days of the date of this order, agencies shall report progress on the implementation of the CAP Goal to the CPO. Thereafter, agencies shall report progress quarterly, and as appropriate.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 
Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 21, 2009, 74 F.R. 4683, provided: 
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Depart­ments and Agencies 
A democracy requires accountability, and account­ability requires transparency. As Justice Louis Bran­deis wrote, ‘‘sunlight is said to be the best of disinfect­ants.’’ In our democracy, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government. At the heart of that commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the Gov­ernment and the citizenry alike. 
The Freedom of Information Act should be adminis­tered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails. The Government should not keep in­formation confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears. Nondisclosure should never be based on an effort to protect the personal interests of Govern­ment officials at the expense of those they are supposed to serve. In responding to requests under the FOIA, ex­ecutive branch agencies (agencies) should act promptly and in a spirit of cooperation, recognizing that such agencies are servants of the public. 
All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open Government. The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA. 
The presumption of disclosure also means that agen­cies should take affirmative steps to make information public. They should not wait for specific requests from the public. All agencies should use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government. Disclosure should be timely. 
I direct the Attorney General to issue new guidelines governing the FOIA to the heads of executive depart­ments and agencies, reaffirming the commitment to ac­countability and transparency, and to publish such guidelines in the Federal Register. In doing so, the At­torney General should review FOIA reports produced by the agencies under Executive Order 13392 of December 14, 2005. I also direct the Director of the Office of Man­agement and Budget to update guidance to the agencies to increase and improve information dissemination to the public, including through the use of new tech­nologies, and to publish such guidance in the Federal Register. 
This memorandum does not create any right or bene­fit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its de­partments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employ­ees, or agents, or any other person. 
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memo­randum in the Federal Register.

At the time rules are adopted under this sub­section, the agency shall include in the state­ment required under section 553(c) of this title, the reasons why the system of records is to be exempted from a provision of this section. 
(l)(1) ARCHIVAL RECORDS.—Each agency record which is accepted by the Archivist of the United States for storage, processing, and servicing in accordance with section 3103 of title 44 shall, for the purposes of this section, be considered to be maintained by the agency which deposited the record and shall be subject to the provisions of this section.

(o) 
MATCHING AGREEMENTS.—(1) No record which is contained in a system of records may be disclosed to a recipient agency or non-Fed­eral agency for use in a computer matching pro-gram except pursuant to a written agreement between the source agency and the recipient agency or non-Federal agency specifying—

 such program will be conducted without any change; and 

(ii)
 each party to the agreement certifies to the Board in writing that the program has been conducted in compliance with the agree­ment. 



(p)
 VERIFICATION AND OPPORTUNITY TO CONTEST FINDINGS.—(1) In order to protect any individual whose records are used in a matching program, no recipient agency, non-Federal agency, or 


source agency may suspend, terminate, reduce, or make a final denial of any financial assist­ance or payment under a Federal benefit pro-gram to such individual, or take other adverse action against such individual, as a result of in­formation produced by such matching program, until— 
(A)(i) the agency has independently verified 
the information; or 
(ii)
 the Data Integrity Board of the agency, or in the case of a non-Federal agency the Data Integrity Board of the source agency, de­termines in accordance with guidance issued by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget that— 

(I)
 the information is limited to identifica­tion and amount of benefits paid by the source agency under a Federal benefit pro-gram; and 

(II)
 there is a high degree of confidence that the information provided to the recipi­ent agency is accurate; 



(B)

(2)
 Independent verification referred to in paragraph (1) requires investigation and con­firmation of specific information relating to an individual that is used as a basis for an adverse action against the individual, including where applicable investigation and confirmation of— 

(A)
 the amount of any asset or income in­volved; 

(B)
 whether such individual actually has or had access to such asset or income for such in­dividual’s own use; and 

(C)
 the period or periods when the individual actually had such asset or income. 



(3)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an agency may take any appropriate action otherwise pro­hibited by such paragraph if the agency deter­mines that the public health or public safety may be adversely affected or significantly threatened during any notice period required by such paragraph. 

(q)
 SANCTIONS.—(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no source agency may disclose any record which is contained in a system of records to a recipient agency or non-Federal agency for a matching program if such source agency has reason to believe that the require­ments of subsection (p), or any matching agree­ment entered into pursuant to subsection (o), or both, are not being met by such recipient agen­cy. 

(2)
 No source agency may renew a matching agreement unless— 


(A) the recipient agency or non-Federal agency has certified that it has complied with the provisions of that agreement; and 
(B) the source agency has no reason to be­lieve that the certification is inaccurate. 

(r)

(s)
 BIENNIAL REPORT.—The President shall bi­ennially submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate a report— 

(1)
 describing the actions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget pursu­ant to section 6 of the Privacy Act of 1974 dur­ing the preceding 2 years; 

(2) 
describing the exercise of individual rights of access and amendment under this section during such years;

 No agency shall rely on any exemption in this section to withhold from an individual any record which is otherwise accessible to such in­dividual under the provisions of section 552 of this title. 

(u)
 DATA INTEGRITY BOARDS.—(1) Every agency conducting or participating in a matching pro-gram shall establish a Data Integrity Board to oversee and coordinate among the various com­ponents of such agency the agency’s implemen­tation of this section. 

(2)
 Each Data Integrity Board shall consist of senior officials designated by the head of the agency, and shall include any senior official des­ignated by the head of the agency as responsible for implementation of this section, and the in­spector general of the agency, if any. The in­spector general shall not serve as chairman of the Data Integrity Board. 

(3)
 Each Data Integrity Board— 

(A)
 shall review, approve, and maintain all written agreements for receipt or disclosure of agency records for matching programs to en­sure compliance with subsection (o), and all relevant statutes, regulations, and guidelines; 

(B)
 shall review all matching programs in which the agency has participated during the year, either as a source agency or recipient agency, determine compliance with applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, and agency agreements, and assess the costs and benefits of such programs; 




(C)
 shall review all recurring matching pro­grams in which the agency has participated during the year, either as a source agency or recipient agency, for continued justification for such disclosures; 

(D)
 shall compile an annual report, which shall be submitted to the head of the agency and the Office of Management and Budget and made available to the public on request, de­scribing the matching activities of the agency, including— 

(i)
 matching programs in which the agency has participated as a source agency or recip­ient agency; 

(ii)
 matching agreements proposed under subsection (o) that were disapproved by the Board; 


(iii) any changes in membership or struc­ture of the Board in the preceding year; 
(iv)

(v)
 any violations of matching agreements that have been alleged or identified and any corrective action taken; and 

(vi)
 any other information required by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to be included in such report; 



(E)
 shall serve as a clearinghouse for receiv­ing and providing information on the accu­racy, completeness, and reliability of records used in matching programs; 

(F)
 shall provide interpretation and guid­ance to agency components and personnel on the requirements of this section for matching programs; 

(G)
 shall review agency recordkeeping and disposal policies and practices for matching programs to assure compliance with this sec­tion; and 

(H)
 may review and report on any agency matching activities that are not matching programs. 



(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a Data Integrity Board shall not ap­prove any written agreement for a matching program unless the agency has completed and submitted to such Board a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed program and such analysis dem­onstrates that the program is likely to be cost effective.2 
(B)
 The Board may waive the requirements of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph if it deter­mines in writing, in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the Director of the Office of Man­agement and Budget, that a cost-benefit analy­sis is not required. 

(C)
 A cost-benefit analysis shall not be re­quired under subparagraph (A) prior to the ini­tial approval of a written agreement for a matching program that is specifically required by statute. Any subsequent written agreement for such a program shall not be approved by the Data Integrity Board unless the agency has sub­mitted a cost-benefit analysis of the program as conducted under the preceding approval of such agreement. 


2So in original. Probably should be ‘‘cost-effective.’’ 

(5)(A) If a matching agreement is disapproved by a Data Integrity Board, any party to such agreement may appeal the disapproval to the Director of the Office of Management and Budg­et. Timely notice of the filing of such an appeal shall be provided by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives. 
(B)
 The Director of the Office of Management and Budget may approve a matching agreement notwithstanding the disapproval of a Data In­tegrity Board if the Director determines that— 

(i)
 the matching program will be consistent with all applicable legal, regulatory, and pol­icy requirements; 

(ii)
 there is adequate evidence that the matching agreement will be cost-effective; and 


(iii) the matching program is in the public interest. 


(C)
 The decision of the Director to approve a matching agreement shall not take effect until 30 days after it is reported to committees de­scribed in subparagraph (A). 

(D)
 If the Data Integrity Board and the Direc­tor of the Office of Management and Budget dis­approve a matching program proposed by the in­spector general of an agency, the inspector gen­eral may report the disapproval to the head of the agency and to the Congress. 

(6)
 In the reports required by paragraph (3)(D), agency matching activities that are not match­ing programs may be reported on an aggregate basis, if and to the extent necessary to protect ongoing law enforcement or counterintelligence investigations. 

(v)
 OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET RE-SPONSIBILITIES.—The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall— 

(1)
 develop and, after notice and opportunity for public comment, prescribe guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in imple­menting the provisions of this section; and
